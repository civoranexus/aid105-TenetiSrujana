## 🧠 SchemeAssist – AI Government Scheme Recommendation System (AID105)

SchemeAssist is an AI-driven decision support system designed to help citizens
identify, prioritize, and understand eligible government welfare schemes.

Instead of static listings, the system analyzes:
- Citizen profile (income, state, category)
- Scheme eligibility rules
- Deadlines and urgency
- Potential financial impact

The output is a **clear, explainable, and prioritized recommendation** that guides
citizens on *what to apply for, when, and why*.

---

## 🔍 AI Decision Pipeline

The SchemeAssist AI follows a transparent, multi-stage decision process:

1. **User Profiling**
   - Income, state, category, and needs

2. **Eligibility Scoring Engine**
   - Rule-based validation with explainable reasons

3. **Deadline & Risk Analysis**
   - Identifies urgency and potential loss due to missed deadlines

4. **Scenario Simulation**
   - Tests eligibility across income variations (what-if analysis)

5. **Explainable AI Layer**
   - Generates human-readable decision traces

6. **Final Priority Ranking**
   - Ranks schemes based on eligibility, urgency, and benefit impact

---

## 🌍 Real-World Use Case

A student or low-income citizen often misses high-value schemes due to:
- Confusing eligibility rules
- Lack of awareness about deadlines
- No clarity on application priority

SchemeAssist solves this by:
- Highlighting urgent schemes first
- Explaining eligibility in simple language
- Warning users about benefit loss risks
- Helping plan applications with limited resources

This makes welfare access **faster, clearer, and more equitable**.

---

## ⭐ Why This Project Stands Out

- ✔ Explainable AI (no black-box decisions)
- ✔ Deadline-aware risk modeling
- ✔ Citizen-friendly explanations
- ✔ Scenario-based eligibility simulation
- ✔ Policy-aligned prioritization logic

The focus is not just accuracy, but **trust, transparency, and usability**.
