🧠 AID105 Project
SchemeAssist – AI Government Scheme Recommendation System
📌 Project Overview

SchemeAssist is an AI-powered decision-support system that helps citizens
identify, prioritize, and understand government welfare schemes based on
their personal profile.

The project focuses on explainable AI, risk-aware recommendations, and
citizen-friendly guidance rather than just raw eligibility matching.

🎯 Problem Statement

Miss deadlines for high-value schemes

Apply to schemes without knowing priority

Get rejected without understanding why

SchemeAssist provides:

AI-based eligibility scoring

Deadline urgency & risk analysis

What-if income simulations

Transparent explanations for every decision

Final ranked list of schemes to apply first
